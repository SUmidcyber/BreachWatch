# Intrusion Detection System Project

This project aims to create a Snort-based Intrusion Detection System (STS) using Docker. The project simulates various attack scenarios to detect abnormal network traffic and potential attacks, and provides package management with a user-friendly interface.

## Features
- **Installing Snort with Docker**: Provides portability and isolation by running Snort inside a Docker container.

- **Simulation of Attack Scenarios**: Simulates different types of attacks (e.g. DoS, port scanning) and observes how Snort detects these attacks.

- **User Interface**: Provides package management and analysis with a user-friendly interface.

## Installation
